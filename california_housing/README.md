# An introduction to machine learning in R | California Housing Data

In this repository you will find the data I used in my R user's group talk about machine learning. I have also included the code
in several different formats to appeal to different people's preferences.

If you want to read (or download) the jupyter notebook file I used in the presentation then click on [Housing_R.ipynb](https://github.com/CNuge/kaggle_code/blob/master/california_housing/Housing_R.ipynb). The python code that it was derived from can be found in [housing_front_to_back.ipynb](https://github.com/CNuge/kaggle_code/blob/master/california_housing/housing_front_to_back.ipynb).

If thats not your style then the basic R code is in [Housing_R.r](https://github.com/CNuge/kaggle_code/blob/master/california_housing/Housing_R.r).

The dataset is hosted [on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/camnugent/california-housing-prices) as well.
